When you click on an offer wall, you will be brought to an external website belonging to other persons and will leave our application(s).

Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply an endorsement by us. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications that may be linked to or from the Services.

  <p><strong><span>7. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</span></strong></p>
  <p><em><strong><span>In Short:</span></strong></em><span> </span><em><span>If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.</span></em></p>
  <p><span>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins when applicable). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform. If you log in using Facebook, we may also request access to other permissions related to your account, such as your friends, check-ins, and likes, and you may choose to grant or deny us access to each individual permission.</span></p>
  <p><span>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</span></p>
  <p><strong><span>8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</span></strong></p>

  <p><span>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than eighty four (84) months past the termination of the user’s account.</span></p>
  <p><span>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</span></p>
  <p><strong><span>9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</span></strong></p>
  <p><em><strong><span>In Short:</span></strong></em><span> </span><em><span>We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</span></em></p>
  <p><span>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</span></p>

  <p><strong><span>12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</span></strong></p>
  <p><span>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</span></p>

We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</span></p>
  <p><span>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.
